## Problem Statement

- **Too Much Data**: Crypto users get lost in endless information
- **Hard to Combine**: On-chain data and market news are scattered
- **Confusing Tools**: Web3 has special wallets & terms that scare newcomers

---

## What We Made

**CryptoDailyBrief** is a **chat-based** tool that shows:

- **On-Chain Data**: Wallet balances & transactions
- **YouTube Trends**: Popular crypto videos
- **Simple Chat**: Talk to the blockchain in real time
- **Unified Dashboard**: Everything in one place

---

## How It Works

1. **Wallet Data**
   - Balances & transactions (via The Graph)

2. **Unified Dashboard**
   - On-chain & off-chain info in one view

3. **Chat with an Agent**
   - Ask about tokens & send transfers through chat

---

## Demo

- **Live Chat Demo**
  Send tokens with simple commands
- **Real-Time Updates**
  Watch balances change as you transfer

---

## Tech Stacks

- **Autonome**
  Deployed AI agent on their platform
- **AgentKit (Coinbase)**
  On-chain wallet & actions for our agent
- **Base**

---

## Future Works
