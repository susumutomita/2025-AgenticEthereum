Here’s a concise script for a **1–2 minute** demo:

---

**1. Intro & Login**
- “Welcome to CryptoDailyBrief. First, I open the login screen. I click ‘Connect Wallet’.”

**2. Dashboard Overview**
- “Now we see the dashboard. It shows my wallet balances, YouTube videos, and contract data.”

**3. ERC1155 Token Check**
- “Here’s the smart contract we deployed on Base Sepolia. We can mint an ERC1155 token and see it in my balance.”

**4. Send ETH via Chat**
- “I’ll type ‘Send 0.001 ETH to 0x7aD8317e9aB4837AEF734e23d1C62F4938a6D950.’ The chat processes this and creates a transaction.”

**5. Confirm on Block Explorer**
- “The transaction goes through, and I can click the link to Sepolia BaseScan. We see the address’s balance has increased.”

**6. Wrap-Up**
- “That’s it! We have a simple chat-based interface that combines on-chain data, videos, and easy token transfers—all in one place.”
